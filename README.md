# Prisoner's Dilemma tested using python

Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous probability dilemma created by Melvin Dresher and Merrill Flood. The math was cool and stuff... But I wouldn't believe it unless I could see it myself.

Here's a link to a video explaining the riddle and explaining the math behind it:

So I made a python script that will generate random numbers and track all the prisoners to see if they all got their numbers right. An the end of each iteration, It will give us the probability of all prisoners finding their numbers.

## Try It Out

You can customize the number of prisoners or the number of test cases as you want

```python
numberOfPrisoners = 100
numberOfRounds = 100000 
```
